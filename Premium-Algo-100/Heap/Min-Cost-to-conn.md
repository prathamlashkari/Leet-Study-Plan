### üìù Description

You have some number of sticks with positive integer lengths. These lengths are given as an array `sticks`, where `sticks[i]` is the length of the ith stick.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths `x` and `y` into one stick by paying a cost of `x + y`. You must connect all the sticks until there is only one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.

### üìò Examples

**Input:**  
`sticks = [2,4,3]`  
**Output:**  
`14`  
**Explanation:**  
You start with sticks = [2,4,3].

1. Combine sticks 2 and 3 for a cost of 2 + 3 = 5. Now you have sticks = [5,4].
2. Combine sticks 5 and 4 for a cost of 5 + 4 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9].  
   There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 5 + 9 = 14.

---

**Input:**  
`sticks = [1,8,3,5]`  
**Output:**  
`30`  
**Explanation:**  
You start with sticks = [1,8,3,5].

1. Combine sticks 1 and 3 for a cost of 1 + 3 = 4. Now you have sticks = [4,8,5].
2. Combine sticks 4 and 5 for a cost of 4 + 5 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9,8].
3. Combine sticks 9 and 8 for a cost of 9 + 8 = 17. Now you have sticks = [17].  
   There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 4 + 9 + 17 = 30.

---

**Input:**  
`sticks = [5]`  
**Output:**  
`0`  
**Explanation:**  
There is only one stick, so you don't need to do anything. The total cost is 0.

### ‚úÖ Constraints

- `1 <= sticks.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= sticks[i] <= 10^4`

### üí° Solution (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int connectSticks(vector<int>& sticks) {
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> qu(sticks.begin(), sticks.end());
        int result = 0;
        while (qu.size() > 1) {
            int a = qu.top(); qu.pop();
            int b = qu.top(); qu.pop();
            result += a + b;
            qu.push(a + b);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
